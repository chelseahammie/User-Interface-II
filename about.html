    <h1> ABOUT </h1>
    <p> I am Chelsea Hamilton. <br>
        I have three fur children. Pudge is the oldest. He is four and is a suspected Husky and for-sure 
        Corgi mix.<br> Kiwi is two, almost three, and she is 1/4 Dauchsund and 3/4 Corgi.<br> Last but not
        least is Xena. She is one, almost two. She is a Great Pyr and is ALL puppy still.<br>
        I am also married with a great man that I've been with since 2012.<br> I also have quite a few medical
        conditions that have in-turn also helped me become a disability advocate, mainly online but still one 
        nonetheless. I also paint acrylics do little DIY projects around the house.  </p>
